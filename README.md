## Description <a name="description"></a>

This recommender uses [FunkSVD](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/how-funk-singular-value-decomposition-algorithm-work-in-recommendation-engines-36f2fbf62cac) to make predictions of ratings. 
It uses either FunkSVD or a knowledge based recommendation (highest ranked) to make recommendations for users. Given a movie, the recommender uses Content based recommendation to provide movies that are most similar. 


## Dataset <a name='dataset'></a>

The MovieTweetings dataset consists of ratings on movies that were contained in well-structured tweets on Twitter. This dataset is the result of research conducted by [Simon Dooms](http://scholar.google.be/citations?user=owaD8qkAAAAJ) (Ghent University, Belgium).
